# Reading Time Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.


## 2. Design the Method Signature

```ruby


# * text is a string with words in it
# * reading time is an integer representing minutes
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby

# 1

# => 0

# 2 






_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._
```

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
